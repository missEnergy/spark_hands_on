# README

This repository exists of 8 notebooks with information and exercises, based on the data in the `data.zip` file. 

The notebooks are developed to be used with Databricks CE. Import these notebooks and upload the 2 csv data files in order to start working.

In Databricks, go to `Data` and then click `Add Data`. Now use the drop or `browse` and upload the 2 csv files from the `data.zip` file.

Don't use any of the automatic options to create a table etc.
We will do that ourselves in `1. Read and Write` ;).

Now, go to `Workspace` and click the arrow button in top of the menu. Click on `Import` and upload the 8 scala files in this repository. (unfortunately 1 by 1)

After that, you are ready to start the first notebook in Databricks. Navigate there again via the `Workspace`.
